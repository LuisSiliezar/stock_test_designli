# Hi, nice to meet you!

Before you continue with the evaluation for this app, there are some things that you need in order to get the project up and running.

## Step 1: Create an `APP_KEY_FINNHUB` in a `.env` file

## Step 2: Accessing Candle Values

The second step differs from the original scope of the task. In order to get Candle values in Finnhub, it requires a paid account. However, I found an alternative using [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) which allowed me to achieve the same result ðŸ¤ž.

In order to access data from Polygon.io, the following is needed:

## Step 3: Create an `API_KEY_POLYGON` in a `.env` file

And that's it for now! You can get the project up and running.

Note: Some of the stock data might be confusing due to my lack of knowledge in that area. I hope I got the correct values. If there's something I could improve on, I will gladly receive feedback.

Thanks in advance, and I hope to get to know you soon ðŸ‘‹
